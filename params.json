I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, Linguistics and German from [Trinity College, Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/) in 2014. This included spending an exchange year on the Erasmus programme in [Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/). I have since worked as an intern in natural language technologies for [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) and am currently working as a software engineer in localisation for [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.net/). Outside of work, I am interested in music, football and technology in all its forms.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
